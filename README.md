## Build instructions
1. Install the matching flavor of [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) for your system.
2. Run the CMake GUI app.
	1. For "Where is the source code" and "Where to build the binaries", put the path to this
		repository. All other options can be left at their defaults.
	2. Click "Configure". If this is the first time running CMake, it'll ask you which compiler and
		IDE you want to use (it autodetects what's installed on your system).
	3. Click "Generate". This should produce project files for the selected IDE.
3. Load the project files in your IDE, and build and run the project!
